 Creates a full swift development environment within a single VM.
swift middleware
 Collective term for components within swift that allows for additional functionality.
swift proxy server
 Acts as the gatekeeper to swift and is responsible for authenticating the user.
swift storage node
 A node that runs swift account, container, and object services.
sync point
 Point in time since the last container and accounts database sync among nodes within swift.
TempAuth
 An authentication facility within swift that allows swift itself to perform authentication and authorization, frequently used in testing and development.
Tempest
 Automated software test suite designed to run against the trunk of the OpenStack core project.
TempURL
 A swift middleware component that allows a user to create URLs for temporary object access.
tenant
A group of users, used to isolate access to nova resources.
 An alternative term for a nova project.
tenant endpoint
 A keystone API endpoint that is associated with one or more tenants.
tenant ID
 Unique ID assigned to each tenant within keystone, the nova project IDs map to the keystone tenant IDs.
token
 An alpha-numeric string of text used to access OpenStack APIs and resources.
tombstone
 Used to mark swift objects that have been deleted, ensures the object is not updated on another node after it has been deleted.
transaction ID
 Unique ID assigned to each swift request, used for debugging and tracing.
unscoped token
 Alternative term for a keystone default token.
updater
 Collective term for a group of swift components that process queued and failed updates for containers and objects.
user
 In keystone each user is associated with one or more tenants, and in nova they can be associated with roles, projects, or both.
user data
 A blob of data that can be specified by the user when launching an instance.
 This data can be accessed by the instance through the metadata service or config drive.
 Commonly used for passing a shell script that is executed by the instance on boot.
VIF UUID
 Unique ID assigned to each quantum VIF.
Virtual Central Processing Unit (vCPU)
 Allows physical CPUs to be sub-divided and those divisions are then used by instances.
 Also known as virtual cores.
Virtual Machine (VM)
 An operating system instance that runs on top of a hypervisor.
 Multiple VMs can run at the same time on the same physical host.
virtual network
 An L2 network segment within quantum.
Virtual Network InterFace (VIF)
 An interface that is plugged into a port in a quantum network.
 Typically a virtual network interface belonging to a VM.
virtual port
 Attachment point where a virtual interface connects to a virtual network.
virtual private network (VPN)
 Provided by nova in the form of cloudpipes, specialized instances that are used to create VPNs on a per-project basis.
virtual server
 Alternative term for a VM or guest.
virtual switch (vSwitch)
 Software that runs on a host or node and provides the features and functions of a hardware based network switch.
virtual VLAN
 Alternative term for a virtual network.
VLAN manager
 A nova networking manager that divides subnet and tenants into different VLANs allowing for Layer 2 segregation.
 Provides a DHCP server for each VLAN to assign IP addresses for instances.
VLAN network
 The Network Controller provides virtual networks to enable compute servers to interact with each other and with the public network.
 All machines must have a public and private network interface.
 A VLAN network is a private network interface, which is controlled by the vlan_interface option with VLAN managers.
VM image
 Alternative term for an image.
VNC proxy
 A nova component that provides users access to the consoles of their VM instances through VNC or VMRC.
volume
 Disk-based data storage generally represented as an iSCSI target with a file system that supports extended attributes, can be persistent or ephemeral.
 Commonly usedas a synonym for block device.
Volume API
 An API on a separate endpoint for attaching, detaching, and creating block storage for compute VMs.
volume controller
 A nova component that oversees and coordinates storage volume actions.
volume driver
 Alternative term for a volume plugin.
volume ID
 Unique ID applied to each storage volume under the nova control.
volume manager
 A nova component that creates, attaches, and detaches persistent storage volumes.
volume node
 A nova node that runs the cinder-volume daemon.
volume plugin
 A plugin for the nova volume manager.
 Provides support for a new and specialized types of back-end storage.
Volume Service API
 Alternative term for the Block Storage API.
volume worker
 The nova component that interacts with back-end storage to manage the creation and deletion of volumes and the creation of compute volumes, provided by the nova-volume daemon.
 Virtual Network InterFace (VIF)
weight
 Used by swift storage devices to determine which storage devices are suitable for the job.
 Devices are weighted by size.
weighted cost
 The sum of each cost used when deciding where to start a new VM instance in nova.
weighing
 A nova process that determines the suitability of the VM instances for a job for a particular host.
 For example, not enough RAM on the host, too many CPUs on the host, and so on.
worker
 A daemon that carries out tasks.
 For example, the nova-volume worker attaches storage to an VM instance.
 Workers listen to a queue and take action when new messages arrive.
Zuul
 Tool used in OpenStack development to ensure correctly ordered testing of changes in parallel.
