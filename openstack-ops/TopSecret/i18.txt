Great work!

The translation system is in Transifex. I’m copying Tom Fifield, community
manager, and Ying Chun Guo (Daisy), our I18n coordinator.

Refer to their team wiki page:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18nTeam
to get more information about translation.

Also, openstack-i18n@lists.openstack.org is the mailing list of OpenStack
translation team. You can communicate with the whole team through this
mailing list.

Here is the link to OpenStack documents in Transifex, our translation tool.

https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openstack-manuals-i18n/


Our system then automatically posts to gerrit and ensure the build
continues. 

Hope this helps you get into the system!
Thanks,
Anne
